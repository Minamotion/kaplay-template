## And now for some well-deserved credits
Thank you [@lajbel](https://github.com/lajbel) from [KAPLAY Team](https://github.com/kaplayjs/) for the [k.env.d.ts](./.vscode/k.env.d.ts) file! _(Link to [Issue#73 on KAPLAY](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/issues/773))_

# How to Version?
Whenever something changes in either the file structure or in [./html/](./html/), increase the version

README files change nothing

We're currently on version Version 5
