## DATA
Place data here
These can be:
- JSON files
- XML files _(needs implementation in `main.js`)_
- TXT files
- CSV files _(needs implementation in `main.js`)_
- Anything really! _(needs implementation in `main.js`)_

To access a asset that isn't a json file through code, do the our following in your code
```javascript
// name: string
k.getSpecialAsset(name)
```
